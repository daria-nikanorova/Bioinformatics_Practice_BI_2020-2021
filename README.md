# Bioinformatics_Practice_BI_2020-2021

This repository corresponds to the course "Practice in bioinformatics" in the first and second semesters in Bioinformatics institute (2020-2021). Reports and supplementary materials for 7 projects can be found here. All projects were done by Anna Rybina and Daria Nikanorova in cooperation.

*Authors: Dasha Nikanorova, Anya Rybina*

**Project #1:** “What causes antibiotic resistance?”. 

*Skills covered:* Alignment to reference, variant calling

The first project is focused on analyzing sequencing data of E.coli to locate the mutations responsible for giving E. coli its antibiotic resistance property.

**Project #2:** “Why did I get the flu?” 

*Skills covered:* Deep sequencing data

The second project concerns viral evolution which sometimes may overcome vaccination benefits. 

**Project #3:** *E.coli* outbreak investigation. 

*Skills covered:* *de novo* assembly, genome-wide comparative analysis

The third project is aimed at investigating the outbreak by assembling the genome of the deadly *E.coli* strain that caused severe outbreak in Germany, 2011, characterized by hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

**Project #4:** Tardigrades: from genestealers to space marines

*Skills covered:* Gene prediction, functional annotation, protein localization

Using functional annotation approach such as sequence homology search, we predicted several candidate proteins that could be essential for ensuring high stress tolerance in tardigrades.

**Project #5:** H+, or how to build a perfect human

*Skills covered:* SNP calling, Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplotype calling

In this project we analyzed 23andMe genome-wide data of a european man in order to pinpoint specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which may result in the development of complex disorders.

**Project #6:** RNA-seq. Baking Bread.

*Skills covered:* RNA-seq data analysis

In this work, based on RNA-seq data analysis we intended to reveal differentially expressed genes in budding yeasts before and during fermentation.

**Project #7:** Dead Man’s Teeth. Introduction to metagenomics analysis.

*Skills covered:* 16S vs whole metagenome, alignment, OTU clustering

In this study we analyzed DNA samples extracted from dental calculus of mediaeval people in order to define bacteria responsible for oral diseases and their evolution in humans.
